# EdgeOS pip configuration
# System-wide pip settings for Jetson devices
#
# This configuration makes pip check the NVIDIA Jetson AI Lab PyPI index
# in addition to the standard PyPI.org index. This provides pre-built,
# optimized wheels for Jetson devices with JetPack 6 and CUDA 12.6.
#
# Available optimized packages include:
# - torch, torchvision, torchaudio (PyTorch 2.8)
# - torch-tensorrt (TensorRT integration)
# - flash-attn, xformers (transformer optimizations)
# - vllm, sglang (LLM inference)
# - opencv-contrib-python (with CUDA support)
# - and many more...
#
# Pip will prefer wheels from Jetson AI Lab when available,
# and fall back to PyPI.org for other packages.

[global]
# Add Jetson AI Lab as an extra index (searches both PyPI.org and this)
extra-index-url = https://pypi.jetson-ai-lab.io/jp6/cu126/

# Optional: Set a reasonable timeout for downloads
timeout = 60

# Optional: Increase verbosity to see which index packages come from
# verbose = 1
