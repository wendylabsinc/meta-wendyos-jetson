-- Disable seat monitoring for headless devices
-- WendyOS has no display server or logind seats, so Bluetooth devices
-- wouldn't be activated without this configuration
--
-- Without this, WirePlumber will wait for a logind seat to exist before
-- enabling Bluetooth audio devices. Since WendyOS is headless, no seat
-- is ever created, and Bluetooth devices stay paired but inactive.
